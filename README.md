The second step is to detect and isolate the pupil area as shown in the following screen shot where the program automatically open multiple windows and automatically align them to show the steps:

Please note that this work is part of an unfinished project on Iris detection that I started years ago with Dr. Loay from Baghdad university, I stopped progressing on the project because I started my Ph.D. program and didn't have the time to finish it. The steps and details of every step is documented in the prgram and the library, please feel free to download and use both of them.
